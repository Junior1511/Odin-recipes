    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p><strong><em>Fried Chicken</em></strong> a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried.</p>
    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken Breast</strong> One batch of this recipe makes about 3-4 chicken breasts, or around one and a half pounds, cut into strips. One chicken breast equals about three strips, the way I cut them.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong> Salted or unsalted butter is fine.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong> All-purpose flour, or you could use gluten-free flour if you prefer.</li>
            <li><strong>Panko</strong> Panko breadcrumbs give the chicken a crunchy, crispy coating. Original or pork rind panko are fine.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Seasoned Salt</strong> This versatile seasoning goes with everything!</li>
            <li><strong>Paprika</strong> Made from dried, ground peppers, paprika is not spicy, but it adds depth of flavor, a slight sweetness, and lots of colour.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Get the Oven and Baking Sheet Ready.</strong> To get started, preheat your oven to 425°F. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet (10×15) with parchment paper, and brush the butter over the surface of the parchment. It might seem like a lot of butter, but that’s fine. It will help to crisp up the chicken coating!</li>
            <li><strong>Bread the Chicken Breast Pieces.</strong> Combine the flour, panko, seasoned salt, salt and pepper, and paprika in a large paper or zip-top bag. Add the chicken to the bag, and shake the bag to coat the chicken pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake.</strong> Place your chicken on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a space between each strip. Bake the chicken for 10 minutes, flip carefully with a spatula, and bake for another 10 minutes. (Note: if the parchment is dry when you flip the chicken, add a drizzle of oil, to the to ensure the bottom pieces of chicken get crispy.)</li>
            <li><strong>Check for Doneness.</strong> Check to make sure your chicken is cooked (165°F), as the thickness can greatly affect baking time. You want it to be done, but not overdone and dry. If it’s not yet up to temperature, bake for another 4-5 minutes at a time, until it’s cooked through</li>
        </ol>
